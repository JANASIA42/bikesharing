## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a series of visualizations that show trends and patterns related to Citibike's NYC customers.  We can use our analysis of New York City bikeshare data from August 2019 to help prospective investors make an informed decision about whether the business would be equally profitable in the city of Des Moines, Iowa.

The story summarizing the below results can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/janasia.roemling3683/viz/Challenge_workbook_story/Story1?publish=yes.


## Results
### Checkout Times for All Users
<img width="926" alt="Checkout_Times_All_Users" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106359572/192177713-33cca257-85de-4263-afc8-1277b9e34bfb.PNG">
 The above image displays the length of time (in minutes, between 0 and 2 hours) for which the bikes were checked out.  The graph shows that the overwhelming majority of rental times were 60 minutes or less, indicating that the bikeshare service is most likely used for errands/daily commutes by locals, rather than leisurely tours by visitors.
 
 ### Checkout Times by Gender

 The above graph breaks down checkout times by gender (male/female/unknown), and reveals that males comprise the majority of customer/subscriber bike rentals.
 
 ### Trips by Weekday per Hour

The above image is a heatmap showing peak hours by day of the week.  Weekend trips are substantial, but the number of bikes en route during the week far exceed these figures during typical rush hours (between 8 and 9 AM and 5 and 7 PM).  Wednesdays seem to be slower, at least for the month of August.

 ### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

The above image shows that gender did not make a difference as far as the peak hours go.

### User Type: Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
<img width="939" alt="User_Trips_by_Gender_by_Weekday" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106359572/192178815-16b0d477-9290-4157-80a6-ca15fa100c54.PNG">
The above heatmap breaks down the frequency of bike rentals by both gender and user type (regular/subscriber vs. one-off rentals by "customers").  It shows that most of the business comes from male subscribers.

### Average Trip Duration by Birth Year

The above chart shows average trip duration by age (birth year).  Trip duration does not seem to have a correlation (negative or positive) with age.  In fact, an astounding number of rides (854) were from customers over the age of 120; the longest trip duration of  40+ minutes was completed by someone nearly 130 years old.

### August Peak Hours

The above bar chart shows that the hours of 5 to 7 PM showed the highest amount of traffic from bike rentals.

## Summary
Our analysis concludes that men subscribers comprise the most business for NYC Citibike, and that business is at its peak during typical rush hours.

Two additional visualizations that could provide further insight would be:
1. The same data during the winter months, to see how drastically commute volume is impacted in colder weather.
2. A heat map that shows average trip length by location, to see whether the duration has any correlation to particular neighborhoods.
